This is a React/Next.js not working example of [react-family-tree](https://github.com/SanichKotikov/react-family-tree)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the error.

You should see a Next.js error:

```text

```
